* List of TODO items [23/37]
** DONE Create an icon
- The plugin API seems to mandate one for a plugin that is to add an action to the GUI
- Need an icon that doesn't have any copyright limitations, it doesn't have to be pretty
** DONE Put a list of books into the dialog
 - <2015-08-23 søn 08:50> Will use a [[http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtableview.html][QTableView]]
   - import:
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       from PyQt5.Qt import QTableView
     #+END_SRC
   - Tried using the derived class BookView, but this failed because the parent (OpdsDialog) was missing the field iactions
   - Will try filling the QtTableView with BooksModel which derives from [[http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstracttablemodel.html][QAbstractTableModel]]
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       from calibre.gui2.library.models import BooksModel
     #+END_SRC
   - The argument to BooksModel.setData will be a list of SearchResult instances
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       from calibre.gui2.store.search_result import SearchResult
     #+END_SRC
   - SearchResult contains the following fields:
     - store_name
     - cover_url
     - cover_data
     - title
     - author
     - price
     - detail_item
     - drm
     - formats
     - downloads
       - dictionary
     - affilate
       - boolean
     - plugin_author
     - create_browser
   - SearchResult equality is determined in the following way:
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       return self.title == other.title and self.author == other.author and self.store_name == other.store_name and self.formats == other.formats
     #+END_SRC
     - The "formats" part of the comparison may be an issue when comparing with the current database? Could be that a comparison that excludes formats may be needed? E.g. I may want to keep ORIGINAL_EPUB in the calibre where I did the conversion, but not bother copying it to other calibres
   - An example usage of creating a list of SearchResult is in calibre in MobileReadStore.deserialize_books
** DONE Read RSS from the plugin and put the resulting data into a datastructure compatible with the calibre db API
 - <2015-08-23 søn 10:17> Will try putting the resulting data into SearchResult initially (as mentioned in the previous TODO item)
 - <2015-08-23 søn 11:05> The feedparser is already present in calibre
   - import statement:
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       from calibre.web.feeds.feedparser import parse
     #+END_SRC
 - <2015-08-23 søn 12:02> The BooksModel used in view.py is directly connected to the database, i.e. can't use that BooksModel
   - Instead created a new BooksModel patterned on the one in the mobileread store
   - Use a new data structure OpdsBook instead of SearchResult
** DONE Populate the list in the GUI with data read from the RSS
 - <2015-08-23 søn 10:18> Hopefully this will be as simple as calling BooksModel.setData
** DONE Make the list of books look a little better (resize the dialog to make room for everything)
** DONE Add a checkbox to filter out newspapers
** DONE Add a checkbox to filter out books already present in the library
** DONE Make the book datamodel be Metadata (add a field to hold the parsed OPDS structure), and parse all available metadata info
** DONE Add a download button to download the selected books
 - <2015-09-04 fre 21:44> Makes a list of all book download links with EPUB first if found and download the first URL in the list
** DONE Fix line height after updates
** DONE Move OPDS reading to the model and use the model refresh instead of setting a new model
** DONE Restore the authors to the OPDS book list
** DONE Make sure all of the books in the library are listed
 - <2015-09-05 lør 10:34> Calibre is set up by default to only deliver 30 items
 - <2015-09-05 lør 23:20> Following the "next" links of the feed until there are no more "next"
** DONE Give feedback on the number of OPDS books downloaded
 - <2015-09-06 søn 12:43> Perhaps update the list after each 30 book chunk has been added?
** DONE Get a display value back for "updated"
 - <2015-09-06 søn 12:28> The value is back, but now there is a value for the initial empty lines
** DONE Reverse the order of requested downloads
 - <2015-09-06 søn 08:12> The idea is that what's started first will finish first and that this will give the same book order in the two calibres
** DONE Set the date/time of the copied book to the date of the original
 - <2015-09-05 lør 23:08> The date returned by "Updated" was the same for all books and the date/time of the last change to the db of the remote calibre
   - Opened an issue to replace this with the Metadata.timestamp attribute of the book: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1492651
 - <2015-09-06 søn 09:25> Use the ajax.py REST API to download the metadata for the remote book
   - Endpoints are:
     - /ajax/book/{book_id}/{library_id=None}
       - Return the metadata of the book as a JSON dictionary.
       - Query parameters: ?category_urls=true&id_is_uuid=false&device_for_template=None
     - /ajax/books/{library_id=None}
       - Return the metadata for the books as a JSON dictionary.
       - Query parameters: ?ids=all&category_urls=true&id_is_uuid=false&device_for_template=None
     - /ajax/categories/{library_id=None}
       - Return the list of top-level categories as a list of dictionaries
       - Each category has the form:
         #+BEGIN_SRC json
           {
             'name': Display Name,
             'url': URL that gives the JSON object corresponding to all entries in this category,
             'icon': URL to icon of this category,
             'is_category': False for the All Books and Newest categories, True for everything else
           }
         #+END_SRC
     - /ajax/category/{encoded_name}/{library_id=None}
       - Return a dictionary describing the category specified by name
       - Query parameters: ?num=100&offset=0&sort=name&sort_order=asc
       - Response:
         #+BEGIN_SRC json
           {
               'category_name': Category display name,
               'base_url': Base URL for this category,
               'total_num': Total numberof items in this category,
               'offset': The offset for the items returned in this result,
               'num': The number of items returned in this result,
               'sort': How the returned items are sorted,
               'sort_order': asc or desc
               'subcategories': List of sub categories of this category.
               'items': List of items in this category,
           }
         #+END_SRC
     - /ajax/books_in/{encoded_category}/{encoded_item}/{library_id=None}
       - Return the books (as list of ids) present in the specified category
       - Query parameters: ?num=100&offset=0&sort=title&sort_order=asc&get_additional_fields=
     - /ajax/search/{library_id=None}
       - Return the books (as list of ids) matching the specified search query.
       - Query parameters: ?num=100&offset=0&sort=title&sort_order=asc&query=
 - <2015-09-06 søn 10:30> Tried using the API
   - http://edwards.hjemme.lan:8080/ajax/books/ returned a 404
   - Added an
     : Accept: application/json
     header to the GET, but still got a 404
 - <2015-09-14 ma 23:56> Timestamps are now received and placed correctly on the book Metadata objects from the OPDS feed, the downloaded metadata hasn't been updated yet
 - <2015-09-15 ti 22:47> Added a "Fix timestamps of selection" button that can be clicked after download
   - I would have preferred to do this automatically, but that would require a callback that could be called after download, and no such callback system exists
   - The "Fix timestamps of selection" button only works for books that have a single author, the db.find_identical_books() method returns nothing when the metadata has more than one author
** DONE Make the "Fix timestamps of selection button" work for books with more than one author
** TODO Copy read marks in calibre's reader from the remote
** TODO Refresh the list as books are downloaded (suppress downloaded books from the list)
** DONE Format the book list with different color for alternate lines
** DONE Add licensing information (GPLv3) on the project level
** DONE Add licensing and copyright information to all files
** TODO Add auto discovery of calibre instances in the LAN
 - <2015-09-06 søn 11:49> Perhaps use the Bonjour protocol? (is this what FBReaderJ uses?)
** TODO Find out why the OPDS reader dialog sometimes disappear after downloading the OPDS
** TODO Find out why some books (in PDF...?) aren't downloaded
** TODO Try to keep the line length correct during intermediate model updates
 - <2015-09-06 søn 16:10> When updating the book list model after each OPDS chunk, the line heights are wrong
   - They are corrected after the final read but they look a bit silly during the intermediate chunks
** TODO Get better matching with existing books (the "Maven cookbook" was already present, but it still showed up)
** TODO Explore the documentation format to see if it is relevant to this plugin
** DONE Add configuration options for defaults for the "hide" checkboxes
** TODO Add recently used dropdown to the opds_url configuration
** TODO Add username/password information to saved opds_url values
** TODO Make the OPDS parsing more robust (hardcoded to the default structure of calibre right now)
** TODO Migrate own code from underscore separation to camelCase (Python has a camelCase modula/pascal feel to it)
** DONE Remove all leftover debug trace
** TODO Add cover thumbnails to the list of books
** TODO Add an exclusion list (a list of books that should be permanently hidden from the comparison)
